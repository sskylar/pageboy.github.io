Yes I am. Chris Jennings and I live in Oxford, UK.

I teach at Oxford Brookes University within the [Oxford International Centre for Publishing][aae24ac8].

## My web sites

[My Digital Publishing Hub site][5f5c75ef]

This site includes all of my eBook production and digital publishing help documents, presentations and screencasts. You can get loads of help if you are using InDesign to create eBooks.

[My boat _Perspectief_][73c6ee63]

I keep my boat on the Thames in Oxford, and am (as often as possible) making extended trips out on the river both upstream and downstream.
